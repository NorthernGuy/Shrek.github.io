	<h1> Somebody once told me </h1>
	<p> the world is gonna roll me<br/>
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br/>
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br/>
In the shape of an L on her forehead
  </p>
  <p>
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br/>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br/>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  </p>
  <p>
So much to do, so much to see<br/>
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br/>
You'll never know if you don't go<br/>
You'll never shine if you don't glow
  </p>
  <p>
Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play<br/>
Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold
  </p>
  <p>
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br/>
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older<br/>
But the meteor men beg to differ<br/>
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
  </p>
  <p>
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br/>
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br/>
My world's on fire. How about yours?<br/>
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.
  </p>
<p>
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas<br/>
I need to get myself away from this place<br/>
I said yep, what a concept<br/>
I could use a little fuel myself<br/>
And we could all use a little change
  </p>
  <p>
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br/>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br/>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  </p>
  <p>
So much to do, so much to see<br/>
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br/>
You'll never know if you don't go<br/>
You'll never shine if you don't glow.
  </p>
<p>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold
